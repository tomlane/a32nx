# A380X Source Files

All source files required to build the A380X project are located in the `src` directory.

The `src` directory is structured as follows:

(preliminary until A380 code is merged)

```
- base            <msfs package base files>
- behavior        <behavior sources files>
- fonts           <fonts files>
- model           <model sources files>
- systems         <TypeScript based systems incl. instruments>
- textures        <textures files>
- wasm            <rust and c++ sources files for wasm>
```
