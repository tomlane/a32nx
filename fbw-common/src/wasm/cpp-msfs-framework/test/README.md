# Cpp Framework Tests

This folder contains tests for the C++ framework.

For now these simple tests are done as compilable single cpp files which can be compiled with a
C++ compiler and run as a standalone executable.

Many IDEs have the ability to run a single test file, so this is a good way to test the framework manually.

Eventually we will have a more automated test system, built into our build process.
